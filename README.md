# TV3 TV Guide Calendar

A calendar in iCalendar (ICS) format for the channels of Catalan TV network [TV3](http://www.ccma.cat/tv3/).

This project is just an excuse for me to play with [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).

## TODO

- Add all available days.
- Add all network channels.
- Add episodes missing details (URLs, description, language(s), ...)
- Link to a public calendar consuming from this service. I think Google Calendar offers this option. This calendar could work to showcase the service without having to subscribe to it.
- `$ ag ' TODO '`
